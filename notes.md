TODO: Elements of success?


## Goals
1. help user understand their own programming-related learner needs by their needs explicitely (questions and decision making)
1. Provide choices and help visualize the different paths and possibilities for each user(?)

## More
* learner logs
  * keep track of the main things you did
    * weekly goal and/or progress
  * concept log
    * what are some of the things you did?
    * "vocabulary practice" <-> "throwback x-day" - looking back at a concept and finding its purpose (again)?

* self-assessment
  * real focus?
    * TODO: what does that mean?
  * time invested (focussed vs. non-focussed?)
  * time enjoyed (focussed vs. non-focussed?)

* externalities
  * control in life

* communications + discussions
  * sharing
  * semi-regular blitz presentations
    * learner log: two very clear pages to talk about a single simple concept
      * (and how its connected to other concepts?)
      * (can have more but only for reference)
    * progress log: ???
  * more interactions with other people?


* sense of direction, choices, decisions
* meaning and purpose
  * "I chose to do this" vs. "they told me to so I did it"

* degree of difficulty?
* head -> table?
  * walls, problems, despair, frustration, failure
* sense of accomplishment
  * seeing the light, warmth, growth?

* practice vs. project work?
* list of relevant resources?

* learning paths
  * start putting things to use and produce something visible to the world on week #2
  * challenges: easy, intermediate, advanced
  * learner supplements: easy, intermediate, advanced
  * categories:
    * programming concepts (more scaffolded; online classes; new concepts + theory?)
    * programming concept practice (small challenges; produce (simple?) output; compare solutions)
    * project practice (reverse engineering; build to spec; compare solutions)
    * project work (build your own thing)
